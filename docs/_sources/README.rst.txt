``salad`` is a library to easily setup experiments using the current
state-of-the art techniques in domain adaptation. It features several of
recent approaches, with the goal of being able to run fair comparisons
between algorithms and transfer them to real-world use cases. The
toolbox is under active development and will extended when new
approaches are published.

üìä Benchmarking Results
-----------------------

One of salad's purposes is to constantly track the state of the art of a variety of domain
adaptation algorithms. The latest results can be reproduced by the files in the ``scripts/``
directory.

-  Translation based approaches

Quick Start
~~~~~~~~~~~

To get started, the ``scripts/`` directory contains several python scripts
for both running replication studies on digit benchmarks and studies on
a different dataset (toy example: adaptation to noisy images).

.. code:: bash

    $ cd scripts
    $ python train_digits.py --log ./log --teach --source svhn --target mnist

Reasons for using solver abstractions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The chosen abstraction style organizes experiments into a subclass of
``Solver``.

Quickstart: MNIST Experiment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As a quick MNIST experiment:

.. code:: python

    from salad.solvers import Solver

    class MNISTSolver(Solver):

        def __init__(self, model, dataset, **kwargs):

            self.model = model
            super().__init__(dataset, **kwargs)

        def _init_optims(self, lr = 1e-4, **kwargs):
            super()._init_optims(**kwargs)

            opt = torch.optim.Adam(self.model.parameters(), lr = lr)
            self.register_optimizer(opt)

        def _init_losses(self):
            pass

For a simple tasks as MNIST, the code is quite long compared to other
PyTorch examples `TODO <#>`__.
